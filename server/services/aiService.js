        : interview_type
} interview questions for a ${experience_level} candidate applying for the role of ${role} at ${
    company_name || "PrepEdge AI"
}.

 Contextual Information:

Company Description:
${company_description || "Not provided."}

Job Description:
${job_description || "Not provided."}

Resume Summary (Projects, Education, Skills, Experience):
${resume_summary || "Not provided."}

Candidate Focus Areas (e.g., DS, System Design, etc.):
${focus_area || "None specified."}

 Instructions:
- Generate a diverse mix of questions that align with the resume, job description, and candidate level.
- For technical questions, focus on core concepts, problem-solving, system design (if applicable), and resume-aligned skills or projects.
- For behavioral questions, include classic prompts like:
  - “Tell me about yourself.”
  - “What are your strengths and weaknesses?”
  - “Describe a time you faced a challenge and how you overcame it.”
  - “Why do you want this role/company?”
- Prioritize relevance to the role, resume, and company mission when crafting behavioral questions.
- Keep questions clear, concise, and numbered (e.g., 1., 2., 3.).

For each question, immediately follow it with an ideal response labeled as:

Preferred Answer: followed by a 1–2 sentence ideal answer (based on the resume, job context, and experience level).

 Output Format:
Numbered list with each question followed by its preferred answer on a new line.

 Example:
1. What is a linked list?  
   Preferred Answer: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a node containing data and a reference to the next node.

2. Tell me about yourself.  
   Preferred Answer: I'm a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in frontend development, having completed 3 projects using React and Tailwind.

Ensure that:
- Technical questions target relevant frameworks, tools, or topics listed in the resume.
- Behavioral questions are introspective and role-focused.
- Answers are not generic — personalize wherever resume data allows.
